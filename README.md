# How it works

SudokuAI is a bot that can solve any sudoku puzzle on https://www.websudoku.com/

Written in Python, the bot uses Python's Imaging Library, PIL and pyautogui to scan the screen, determine the grid, solve the puzzle
and fill in the squares in under 30 seconds.

It uses core artificial intelligence algorithms such as search and constraint propogation to solve the puzzle. The actual puzzle takes under
a second to solve, while scanning the screen and determining the grid takes approximately 18 seconds, and filling in the squares with the solved
puzzle takes another 10 seconds.
